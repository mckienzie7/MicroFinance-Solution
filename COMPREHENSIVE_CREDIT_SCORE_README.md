| **Score Components** | Simple weighted average | Detailed component breakdown |
| **Risk Assessment** | Basic score rating | Comprehensive risk analysis |
| **Loan Recommendations** | Generic limits | Personalized recommendations |
| **Improvement Guidance** | Basic suggestions | Detailed action plans |
| **Historical Tracking** | Limited | Comprehensive progression |
| **Admin Analytics** | Basic stats | Advanced analytics dashboard |

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// Get comprehensive credit score
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/comprehensive-credit-score', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  }
});
const scoreData = await response.json();

// Display score with breakdown
console.log(`Credit Score: ${scoreData.credit_score}`);
console.log(`Rating: ${scoreData.score_rating}`);
console.log(`Risk Level: ${scoreData.risk_assessment.risk_level}`);

// Show component breakdown
Object.entries(scoreData.score_breakdown).forEach(([component, data]) => {
  console.log(`${component}: ${data.score} (${data.contribution} points)`);
});
```

### Check Loan Eligibility
```javascript
const eligibilityResponse = await fetch(
  '/api/v1/comprehensive-credit-score/loan-eligibility?amount=25000',
  {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  }
);
const eligibility = await eligibilityResponse.json();

if (eligibility.loan_eligibility.eligible) {
  console.log(`Approved for up to ${eligibility.loan_eligibility.max_loan_amount} ETB`);
  console.log(`Interest rate: ${eligibility.loan_eligibility.interest_rate_range[0]}-${eligibility.loan_eligibility.interest_rate_range[1]}%`);
}
```
